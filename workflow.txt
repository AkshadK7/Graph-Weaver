1. An input webpage is provided
2. Scrape all the links present on the webpage
3. Now loop over all the links present which have a parent root domain the same as the input root domain and scrape all the links present in those webpages
4. Follow the same recursive process until you reach to the leaf node, that is : all the links open up to some other domain or no link is present on that webpage
5. Now finally, we need to create this entire hierarchical structure onto a graph with all the webpages serving as nodes with the root node being the input url's webpage. (We can have 3 properties of each node : name, url, current_date) and a relationship between the nodes as HAS_CHILD.
6. Build the Neo4J Graph DB.
